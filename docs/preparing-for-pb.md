The few weeks since Open Data Week have been hugely important in defining the direction of Community Canvas.

## Shifting Gears

Speaking with Adrienne was a huge turning point -- ordinary people shouldn't feel like they have to qualify their demands of elected officials. Besides the logistic hurdles of getting accurate numbers representing how much things cost and when, placing too much emphasis on the financial constraints of PB would not be effective towards encouraging involvement with the process. 

But how do we also address the reality that costs and budgets play a big role in the process nevertheless? After speaking with urban planners from the Municipal Arts Society, one idea was backcasting, or predicting the cost of a user's design based on past projects. 

In other words, the educational function of Community Canvas should have as much importance as its creative or generative application. 

## Dividing into Parts

With this new agenda in mind, we were able to segment Community Canvas into five components that could be developed independently while also supporting, or playing off of one another:
1. Database: One of the original goals of Community Canvas was to let users share their ideas with one another -- to that end, it will be necessary to have some kind of centralized storage of the models used and their geospatial locations.
2. Map-based Visualization: To offer access to Community Canvas regardless of which device is being used, we want to build it on web. Ideally, a user can generate a link that they can then share on other platforms. 
3. AR Visualization: AR offers a unique, immersive means of experiencing a design, but should not become a barrier to participation. By separating the map and AR visualizations, development of the AR functionalities is also simplified by placing less emphasis on UI and navigation.  
4. PB Education: We are presenting these design tools in context of the participatory budgeting process, with the ultimate goal of supporting enagement. Rather than limiting the creativity and ideation of users through introducing a budget, we can lead users to make their own conclusions about the process through an "encyclopedia" of past projects, and channels to existing resources.
5. Physical Installation: Finally, to put participatory budgeting in the context of our lived environment, we want to create invitations to learn about the topic through small-scale, semi-permanent installations, on sites where funds from PB were implemented, in the locales of organizations that were responsible for implementing such projects, and in other frequented public spaces. 

## Next Steps

There are two events coming up that we're hoping to participate in as Community Canvas: annual voting for PB from 4/6 - 4/14, and No Car Earth Day on 4/20.

These two opportunities could help us test the following assumptions we've had:
* People will interact with QR codes in public spaces if they're presented in a compelling or provocative manner.
* If information about PB is presented more concisely, people will engage with the process or try to learn more about it.
* People prefer to visually represent their ideas than write them through text when it comes to public spaces. Or, given the opportunity to represent an idea visually in addition to text, they are more likely to try it than not. 
* A visual reference or interface allows a wider range of ideas for PB than (or a categorically different set of ideas than) text prompts.

In anticipation of voting week, Tom and I are going to prototype a few models for QR-based interactive installations, while Lily and Yidan create a landing page prototype where we can direct the QR code. Dynamic QR codes will allow us to track the number of times a code has been scanned, which we use to our advantage to test where people are more likely to engage.
