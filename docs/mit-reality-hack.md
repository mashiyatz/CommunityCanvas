Our project began at MIT Reality Hack 2024, where we were tasked with designing an XR application that fosters connection within the urban environment. "Community" and "accessibility" were among that terms that resonated with us, which led us to consider the various kinds of accessibility issues members of the community face, in terms of mobility, information, language and beyond.

## Brainstorming Our Concept

We were eager to try the Lenovo ThinkReality smart glasses. Together with the Motorola Edge and the Snapdragon Spaces SDK, they presented a unique "half-step" between the smartphones of now and XR headsets of the future, offering the best of both worlds.

We brainstormed how we would take advantage of the two interfaces. Yidan, who has a background in filmmaking, shared how she could imagine a director "swiping" through different set designs and visualizing them through the smart glasses. From there, we considered what that would look like outside the studio - if any one of us could reimagine what our neighborhood could look like. And with that, Community Canvas began to take form!

For our app, we wanted to balance attention between the interface of the phone and smart glasses. We used the phone as a "remote control" through which users could select settings and 3D models they wanted to place in public spaces, and the smart glasses exclusively to visualize the output. It was an exciting concept - and we considered all sorts of features such as an "upvote" function to show which ideas were most popular; using a searchbar to find or even generate assets; and an option to overlay different designs. 

But through development, it became clear that it would be difficult to realize these features in practice. The glasses ran hot while draining the phone's battery, and the app crashed every few builds. The glasses worked exclusively with the Snapdragon-powered Microsoft Edge, and could cost $1500 apiece. While it was interesting to work with such cutting-edge technology during the hackathon, it was hard to see our idea grow relying exclusively on this design.
