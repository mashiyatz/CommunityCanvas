**Community Canvas** is an AR platform for facilitating communication between local government representatives in NYC and their constituents about the participatory budgeting process and development of shared urban spaces.

I started taking notes to sketch out my thoughts on the fly.

## Phase 1: MIT Reality Hack 2024

In our earliest iteration of Community Canvas, we wanted to balance attention between the interface of the phone and the Lenovo smart glasses, the two of which made up the Snapdragon Space devkit that Qualcomm provided us through the hackathon. We used the phone as a "remote control" through which users could select settings and 3D models they wanted to place, and the smart glasses exclusively to visualize the output. It was an exciting concept - a kind of half-step between the familiar world of smart phones and the purported VR revolution that let us dip our toes into the best of both worlds. But in practice, the glasses ran hot while draining the phone's battery, and the app crashed every few builds. 

## Who are we? 

We're a group of graduate students from NYU ITP, with backgrounds in physics, film, architecture, computer science, and media arts. We began this project in January 2024 at MIT Reality Hack, where we used the Snapdragon Spaces SDK for Unity and Lenovo ThinkReality A3 smart glasses to design our earliest version of Community Canvas. We were recognized as finalists, and won Best Application of Snapdragon Spaces, but after receiving such great feedback from judges, mentors, and fellow hackers, we realized our work wasn't finished yet! 
<br><br>
Since then, we've participated in the NYU Startup Bootcamp, spoken with community liaisons from district offices around the city, consulted professionals in the XR space, and even taken on the further development of the app as a master's thesis. We're looking forward to learning and experimenting even more, and would love to be in touch if you have leads!
