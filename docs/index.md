## Who are we? 

We're a group of graduate students from NYU ITP, with backgrounds in physics, film, architecture, computer science, and media arts. We began this project in January 2024 at MIT Reality Hack, where we used the Snapdragon Spaces SDK for Unity and Lenovo ThinkReality A3 smart glasses to design our earliest version of Community Canvas. We were recognized as finalists, and won Best Application of Snapdragon Spaces, but after receiving such great feedback from judges, mentors, and fellow hackers, we realized our work wasn't finished yet! 
<br><br>
Since then, we've participated in the NYU Startup Bootcamp, spoken with community liaisons from district offices around the city, consulted professionals in the XR space, and even taken on the further development of the app as a master's thesis. We're looking forward to learning and experimenting even more, and would love to be in touch if you have leads!
