# How to set up

To start using this asset I would recommend downloading the asset "Json.NET Converters - Simple compatible solution" from Wanyzee Studio:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-converters-simple-compatible-solution-58621

This asset is completely free and will take care of serializing a bunch of unity types. If you are having problems with
dictionaries just delete the following script:

WanzyeeStudio > Scripts > Runtime > Concrete > Json > DictionaryConverter

And run the tests to make sure that everyting is working properly.
